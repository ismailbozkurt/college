College Papers 
===============

In this repository you can find different papers I've developed during my college years. They are the final research projects of each of my degrees. 

The TFC project is the basic one and the TFM is somewhat more advanced. Both projects are related with software exploitation. The TFC is entitled `Introduction to software exploiting in Linux systems` and TFM `Study and exploitation of the dynamic memory management in GNU/Linux systems`.

Here you can also find the tex source code of each project so you can use them. I hope this can save you some time fighting against `LaTeX` ;)
By the way, the second project - TFM - is more advanced or well organized regarding tex sources. So you better take the code from this one rather than the TFC.

Finally, what are the bad news? The reports are written in `spanish`! Feel free to translate them :P
